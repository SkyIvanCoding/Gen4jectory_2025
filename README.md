# Gen4jectory Algorithm â€“ 4-D Trajectory Planning for Rotary-Wing UAVs

## Overview
Gen4jectory 2.0 is a 4-D trajectory-planning framework for fleets of rotary-wing UAVs. It employs a rigorous OBB-vs-OBB collision check based on the Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) to guarantee zero Loss-of-Separation (LoS) events within each drone's separation volume. By fusing high-fidelity rotorcraft performance models with a traffic-aware pathfinder and time-parameterised trajectory smoothing, Gen4jectory 2.0 rapidly generates conflict-free schedules that honour individual aircraft kinematics and air-space constraints. The project includes detailed physical modelling, map representation, trajectory generation, and outlines future research directions.
## Project Objectives
Developing a multi-drone trajectory planning algorithm for air-space safety.
